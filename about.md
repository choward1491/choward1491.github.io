Hey! My name is Christian and I am currently a PhD student in the Computer Science department at **UIUC**. My advisor is [Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/) and together we work on problems in the realm of theoretical computer science. Some of the areas I currently enjoy thinking about are optimization, randomization in algorithms and complexity theory, computational geometry, and learning theory.

I have two amazing dogs that you can find pictures of on [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/choward1491/) account. I have fun making things, ranging from software to food to artwork. Feel free to reach out if you have any projects you think I could find interesting. You can find me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjhoward1491/) or just shoot me an email with the contact info below!
